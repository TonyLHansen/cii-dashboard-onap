This is a dashboard showing the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Badging Program](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)
scores for all [Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP)](https://wiki.onap.org) projects.
ONAP consists of a large number of subprojects that each have their own individual badging scores.

With a small amount of customization, this dashboard could potentially be used with other large opensource projects
that consist of multiple subprojects.
