E.G., multi-factor authentication, such as requiring both a password and a hardware token, is stronger than single-factor authentication) </li><li>least privilege (processes should operate with the least privilege necessary) </li><li>least common mechanism (the design should minimize the mechanisms common to more than one user and depended on by all users, e.g., directories for temporary files) </li><li>psychological acceptability (the human interface must be designed for ease of use - designing for 'least astonishment' can help) </li><li>limited attack surface (the attack surface - the set of the different points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data - should be limited) </li><li>input validation with whitelists (inputs should typically be checked to determine if they are valid before they are accepted; this validation should use whitelists (which only accept known-good values), not blacklists (which attempt to list known-bad values)). </li></ul> A 'primary developer in a project is anyone who is familiar with the project's code base, is comfortable making changes to it, and is acknowledged as such by most other participants in the project.
