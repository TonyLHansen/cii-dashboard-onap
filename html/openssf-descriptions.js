E.G., multi-factor authentication, such as requiring both a password and a hardware token, is stronger than single-factor authentication) <li>least privilege (processes should operate with the least privilege necessary) <li>least common mechanism (the design should minimize the mechanisms common to more than one user and depended on by all users, e.g., directories for temporary files) <li>psychological acceptability (the human interface must be designed for ease of use - designing for \'least astonishment\' can help) <li>limited attack surface (the attack surface - the set of the different points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data - should be limited) <li>input validation with allowlists (inputs should typically be checked to determine if they are valid before they are accepted; this validation should use allowlists (which only accept known-good values), not denylists (which attempt to list known-bad values)). </ul> A \'primary developer\' in a project is anyone who is familiar with the project\'s code base, is comfortable making changes to it, and is acknowledged as such by most other participants in the project. A primary developer would typically make a number of contributions over the past year (via code, documentation, or answering questions).

Similarly, when creating a Debian package, you may put a link in the copyright file to the license text in /usr/share/common-licenses, and exclude the license file from the created package (e.g., by deleting the file after calling dh_auto_install).

A project that is actively pursuing a badge is probably maintained. All projects and people have limited resources, and typical projects must reject some proposed changes, so limited resources and proposal rejections do not by themselves indicate an unmaintained project. <br><br> When a project knows that it will no longer be maintained, it should set this criterion to \'Unmet\' and use the appropriate mechanism(s) to indicate to others that it is not being maintained. For example, use \u201cDEPRECATED\u201d as the first heading of its README, add \u201cDEPRECATED\u201d near the beginning of its home page, add \u201cDEPRECATED\u201d to the beginning of its code repository project description, add a <a href=\'https://unmaintained.tech/\'>no-maintenance-intended badge</a> in its README and/or home page, mark it as deprecated in any package repositories (e.g., <a href=\'https://docs.npmjs.com/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions\'>npm deprecate</a>), and/or use the code repository\'s marking system to archive it (e.g., GitHub\'s <a href=\'https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/archiving-a-github-repository\'>\'archive\' setting</a>, GitLab\u2019s <a href=\'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/#archiving-a-project\'>\'archived\' marking</a>, Gerrit\'s \'readonly\' status, or SourceForge\u2019s \'abandoned\' project status).
